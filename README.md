Step1: Run "Classes.py"
Step2: Run "SQLite.py"
Step3: Run "NameLists.py"
Step4: Before running "SQLiteQueries.py", you need to modify the 3 database source ("where your datavase is"). for ex: C:\Users\qazol\PycharmProjects\VotingSystem3\VotingDatabase3.db.
Step5: In the "MainGUI.py", make sure there are no errors in the first 10 lines of code. It should be an error on "from PIL import Image, ImageTk", you can solve that by installing the packet "pillow" (on internet you can find the way how to install it, if not, just ask me(gabriele)).
Step6: Run "VotingResults".
Step7: Run "MainGUI", you can use any username and password from "SQLite.py".
Thank you :)
